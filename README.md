ThumbsUp is my personal project that I worked during my university years. It is a social media based project where multiple 
users can connect with each other and start chatting. Besides, they can share status and if they are already connected, they 
can like or unlike each other's statuses. 

I have used this project as a final project for one of my classes that I was taking at the university. Whole idea, design 
implementation belongs to me. The major goal on this project was to create concurrent application which works with multiple
threads.
